Phase 15 — ContextualResultAdapter

Deterministic translation boundary between Group 2 contextual_result
(temporal applicability ruling) and a DecisionContract candidate.

Responsibilities (ONLY):
  1. Validate that all required fields are present in the ruling.
  2. Apply deterministic translation rules (GAP → abstention/noop).
  3. Preserve provenance fields (observation_id, context_id, trace_id,
     execution_id) unchanged into DecisionContract.parameters.
  4. Enforce the hard safety invariant: GAP rulings MUST NOT produce
     operational actions.

This module does NOT:
  - Call ActionGovernance
  - Write to any log or database
  - Generate new IDs to replace existing ones
  - Interpret the scientific context artifact (TC-Z03-F02-LIDAR-OBS001.json)
    — it only reads the ruling artifact (temporal_applicability_ruling.json)

Contract reference (Kaushal's actual field names):
  backend/integration/group2/temporal_applicability_ruling.json
    ruling           → "GAP" | "ALLOW" | "ADAPT"
    action_eligibility → bool
    abstention_required → bool
    observation_id   → str
    context_id       → str
