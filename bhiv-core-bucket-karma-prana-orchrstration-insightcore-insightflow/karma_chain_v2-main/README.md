```

## System Status

⚠️ **Development Stage** - System has core functionality implemented with testing, but requires integration with Sovereign Core for production deployment

## PRANA Integration Boundary

⚠️ **PASSIVE OBSERVATION ONLY** - The Karma system currently operates in a passive inspection mode for PRANA integration:

- PRANA → BHIV Bucket → Karma (consumption boundary)
- Karma consumes PRANA packets ONLY from the Bucket
- Karma logs and inspects packets only
- Karma does NOT act on PRANA yet
- Karma does NOT influence user experience
- Karma does NOT send feedback upstream

No scoring, no feedback loops, no UX impact at this stage. This boundary ensures PRANA and Karma never communicate directly, maintaining system integrity during the training phases of both systems.

## Integration Guide

### Unified Event Gateway

The recommended way to integrate with KarmaChain is through the unified event gateway:

```
POST /v1/karma/event
{
  "event_type": "life_event",
  "user_id": "user123",
  "data": {
    "role": "human",
    "action": "help",
    "description": "Helped a colleague with debugging"
  }
}
```

### Ecosystem Hooks

For direct integration with specific modules, use the karma API endpoints:

```
GET /api/v1/karma/{user_id}              # Get full karma profile
POST /api/v1/log-action/                 # Log user action
POST /api/v1/submit-atonement/           # Submit atonement completion
```

These endpoints provide module-specific scores for Finance, InsightFlow, Gurukul, and Game.

### File Upload Support

Upload files as evidence for atonement events:

```
POST /v1/karma/event/with-file
Form Data:
  - event_data: JSON string with event details
  - file: Upload file (jpg, jpeg, png, pdf, doc, docx)
```

### Supported Event Types

- `life_event`: Log karma actions and behaviors
- `appeal`: Submit karma appeals
- `atonement`: Request and complete atonement plans
- `atonement_with_file`: Atonement with supporting evidence files
- `death_event`: Record death events for karma transfer
- `stats_request`: Query user karma statistics

### Karmic Feedback Engine

Compute and retrieve karmic influence data:

```
POST /api/v1/feedback_signal              # Compute and publish feedback signal
GET /api/v1/feedback_signal/{user_id}     # Get feedback signal for a user
POST /api/v1/feedback_signal/batch        # Batch process multiple users
GET /api/v1/feedback_signal/health        # Check system health
GET /api/v1/feedback_signal/config        # Get engine configuration
```

### Behavioral State Normalization

Normalize multi-module behavioral inputs:

```
POST /api/v1/normalize_state              # Normalize single state
POST /api/v1/normalize_state/batch        # Normalize batch of states
```

### Karmic Analytics

Access karmic analytics and visualization:

```
GET /api/v1/analytics/karma_trends        # Get karmic trends data
GET /api/v1/analytics/charts/dharma_seva_flow  # Generate Dharma/Seva flow chart
GET /api/v1/analytics/charts/paap_punya_ratio  # Generate Paap/Punya ratio chart
GET /api/v1/analytics/exports/weekly_summary   # Export weekly summary CSV
GET /api/v1/analytics/metrics/live        # Get live karmic metrics
```

### STP Bridge Integration

Secure telemetry forwarding to external systems:

```
POST /api/v1/stp/forward                  # Forward telemetry to external systems
GET /api/v1/stp/status                    # Check STP bridge status
POST /api/v1/stp/configure                # Configure STP bridge settings
```

The STP (Secure Telemetry Protocol) Bridge enables secure forwarding of karmic telemetry to external systems like Unreal Engine, InsightFlow, and other partner platforms.

### Event Bus System

Real-time event broadcasting and messaging:

```
GET /api/v1/events/subscribe              # Subscribe to real-time event stream
POST /api/v1/events/publish               # Publish events to the bus
GET /api/v1/events/history                # Get recent event history
```

The Event Bus system provides real-time broadcasting of karmic events to all connected clients, enabling dynamic updates in visualization systems.

### Karmic Lifecycle Engine

Full karmic lifecycle simulation (Birth → Life → Death → Rebirth):

```
GET /api/v1/karma/lifecycle/prarabdha/{user_id}     # Get user's Prarabdha counter
POST /api/v1/karma/lifecycle/prarabdha/update       # Update Prarabdha karma
POST /api/v1/karma/lifecycle/death/check            # Check death threshold
POST /api/v1/karma/lifecycle/death/process          # Process death event
POST /api/v1/karma/lifecycle/rebirth/process        # Process rebirth
POST /api/v1/karma/lifecycle/simulate               # Run lifecycle simulation
```

The Karmic Lifecycle Engine implements the complete cycle of existence with threshold-based death events and karma inheritance through rebirth.

## Token Schema & Scoring System

### Advanced Karma Tokens

The system implements a comprehensive token schema based on Vedic principles:

#### Primary Tokens
- **DharmaPoints**: Righteous action points based on dharma compliance
- **SevaPoints**: Service and selfless action points
- **PunyaTokens**: Merit tokens for virtuous actions
- **PaapTokens**: Demerit tokens with severity levels (1-10)

#### Karma Types
- **DridhaKarma**: Fixed karma that must be experienced
- **AdridhaKarma**: Flexible karma that can be modified
- **SanchitaKarma**: Accumulated karma from past actions
- **PrarabdhaKarma**: Karma currently being experienced
- **Rnanubandhan**: Karmic debt relationships

### Purushartha Scoring

Actions are evaluated against the four Purushartha principles:

#### Dharma (Righteousness)
- Compliance with moral and ethical duties
- Adherence to universal laws and principles
- Impact on spiritual growth and liberation

#### Artha (Prosperity)
- Material and spiritual wealth generation
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Contribution to collective prosperity

#### Kama (Desire)
- Fulfillment of legitimate desires
- Balance between desire and restraint
- Impact on overall well-being

#### Moksha (Liberation)
- Progress toward spiritual liberation
- Reduction of karmic bonds
- Advancement on the path to enlightenment

### Q-Learning Integration

The system uses Q-learning algorithms to:
- Predict karmic outcomes based on user patterns
- Recommend optimal atonement plans
- Adapt scoring based on user behavior
- Provide personalized spiritual guidance

### Atonement System

Comprehensive atonement framework with three pillars:

#### Daan (Charity)
- Material donations and charitable acts
- Service to others and community support
- Resource sharing and generosity

#### Bhakti (Devotion)
- Spiritual practices and devotion
- Meditation, prayer, and ritual observance
- Cultivation of divine connection

#### Tap (Austerity)
- Self-discipline and penance
- Fasting and physical purification
- Mental and spiritual austerity practices

Each atonement type has specific units and effectiveness ratings based on the severity of PaapTokens being addressed.
